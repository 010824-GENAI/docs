# GenAI Capstone Project

In this capstone project, you will be creating an AI Chatbot using Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The project should be able to engage in conversations with users and answer questions about topics it did not encounter during its training by leveraging external data.

## Project Requirements

- Users should interact with a LangChain Agent, an LLM equipped with tools.
- Tools should retrieve data and provide additional context to the Agent to answer the user's questions (e.g., retrieve data from documents, the web, databases, etc.).
- The project should utilize a vector database and an embedding model to enable semantic search.
- The Agent should maintain a memory of the ongoing chat.
- A chat UI should be provided by Streamlit.

## Technologies

The project will utilize the following technologies:

- Python
- LLM
- LangChain
- Vector database and an embedding model
- Various data sources (documents, databases, etc.)
- Streamlit
