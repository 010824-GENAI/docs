    "- Understand the concept of LLMs (Language Model Models) and their application in various tasks.\n",
    "- Explore the different techniques available for utilizing LLMs effectively.\n",
    "- Learn and apply best practices for using LLMs, including considerations for security.\n",
    "Additionally we'll start utilizing Zephyr-7b-beta model later in the week.\n",

    "## Large Language Model\n",
    "LLM refers to a Large Language Model, and it is a specific type of a natural language processing model that are trained on massive amount of text data. They are capable of advanced language understanding and generation.\n",

    "### Prompting\n",
    "- A _prompt_ is a natural language text input that is given to a Large Language Model\n",
    "- It can contain one or more of the following:\n",
    "  - Instruction\n",
    "  - Context\n",
    "  - Input Data\n",
    "  - Output Indicator\n",
    "- Prompting, or prompt engineering, is a _process_ of creating prompts to generate desired results from an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompting Best Practices\n",
    "- Be clear and specific\n",
    "  - \"What should I do?\" vs \"I have 3 hours to kill in Portland International Airport. I don’t want to leave the airport. Provide me with 5 physically active things to do in the airport. Format the suggestions in bullet points. Keep each bullet points to 50 words or less\"\n",
    "- Use delimiters to indicate different parts of the text\n",
    "  - Translate the following text delimited by triple quotation marks: \"\"\"Your text to translate here\"\"\"\n",
    "- Use output indicator to encourage an LLM to produce response\n",
    "- Be iterative\n",
    "- Prefer \"Do\" over \"Don't\"\n",
    "  - \"Don’t ramble\" vs \"be concise and keep your output to 2-3 sentences.\"\n",
    "- Give context whenever necessary\n",

    "### Prompting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want to prompt an LLM to tell you color of the object you describe. (ie: User: milk AI: white)\n",
    "   - Come up with a zero-shot prompt\n",
    "   - How about a few-shot prompt?\n",
    " \n",
    "2. You're traveling! Create a prompt to have an LLM help you pack from the following list of items:\n",
    "   - Toothbrush, cat, toothpaste, 24\" monitor, work laptop, personal laptop, toiletries, phone, passport, wallet, charger, business casual clothes, textbook, bookshelf, desk, car keys, car, (feel free to add more here...) \n",
    "   - Come up with another prompt to help you with traveling. What kind of context will you give?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improve the following prompts:\n",
    "   - \"Tell me something interesting\"\n",
    "   - \"Write a paragraph\"\n",
    "   - \"What is evolution?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Prompt an LLM to become an ordering chatbot. It should know at least a few products of your business and have a sort of flow it will be following. (first greet, then ask.. etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a prompt to generate a certain type of text (i.e. research abstract on cat genetics for their coat color). Then create another prompt to use the text it generated to generate a different type of text material (i.e. a whimsical poem) on the same content.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a prompt to analyze sentiment of the text you provide. However, instead of the default Positive, Neutral, Negative, you want to use words \"positivi\", \"nutral\", and \"negetiv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus**: Take this prompt and use it on (Zephyr model)[https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat]. How does it perform compared to ChatGPT? Did you have to change anything to make it work?"
