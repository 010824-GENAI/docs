    "## Large Language Model\n",
    "LLM refers to a Large Language Model, and it is a specific type of a natural language processing model that are trained on massive amount of text data. They are capable of advanced language understanding and generation.\n",

    "### Prompting\n",
    "- A _prompt_ is a natural language text input that is given to a Large Language Model\n",
    "- It can contain one or more of the following:\n",
    "  - Instruction\n",
    "  - Context\n",
    "  - Input Data\n",
    "  - Output Indicator\n",
    "- Prompting, or prompt engineering, is a _process_ of creating prompts to generate desired results from an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompting Best Practices\n",
    "- Be clear and specific\n",
    "  - \"What should I do?\" vs \"I have 3 hours to kill in Portland International Airport. I don’t want to leave the airport. Provide me with 5 physically active things to do in the airport. Format the suggestions in bullet points. Keep each bullet points to 50 words or less\"\n",
    "- Use delimiters to indicate different parts of the text\n",
    "  - Translate the following text delimited by triple quotation marks: \"\"\"Your text to translate here\"\"\"\n",
    "- Use output indicator to encourage an LLM to produce response\n",
    "- Be iterative\n",
    "- Prefer \"Do\" over \"Don't\"\n",
    "  - \"Don’t ramble\" vs \"be concise and keep your output to 2-3 sentences.\"\n",
    "- Give context whenever necessary\n",
